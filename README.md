# Project Description

This project aims to predict which infectious disease will have the highest number of new infections in the coming years. This project looks at h3n2 Influenza, h1n1 Influenza, h1 Influenza, h3 Influenza, Measles, and Whooping Cough.

This project focuses on answering the following research questions:

1. Which diseases are strongly correlated to each other?
2. Do preventable diseases have outbreaks during the same time periods?
3. Looking at past trends in the numbers of infected individuals, what are the projected number of infected individuals over the next few years?
4. Looking at each disease's projected infections, which disease is likely to have the next outbreak?

The data for this project is collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rockland County, NYC Health, Washington State Department of Health, California Department of Public Health, City of El Paso, and the New York State Department of Health.
